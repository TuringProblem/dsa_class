This is where new Alleles come from - once youu have the new allele when you have sexual reproduction - you get new combinations and constantly shuffling the alleles

Mkaing different Gametes that not all get's passed on. These different combinations lead to a different individual (taller, skin color, eye color, etc.) - That is not because the allele is new, it's just a mutation that didn't happen before




1) Natural selection can act on traits controlled by a single gene locus and on polygenic traits
true
2) The ultimate source of new alleles is mutation,  

Microevolution - Change in allele frequencies in a population over successive generations
Change in allele freq from generation after generation.
Gene pool - All copies of every type of allele at every gene locus in a population

------
come prepared next tuesday being able to do hardy-weinberg equation - it is predictive

Ask the three questions

1)  Characterize the gene pool
2) Make a prediction based on a lack of evolution
3) Compare w/ the population in front of you.


measure the ph of each solution
get the first number, second number and then measure the two.

Distint smell by the lipids vs smell from things that can only eat the sugars







skillful part of the day
- Agar plates
- Bags full of ph sticks
- beacor

We want to get into our container of milk with the loop (on the stick) - Everytime we are done we will throw away
- DIP ONE TIME AND SWAB A QUADTRANT
- write on the BOTTOM of them not on the lid
- Dip the stick into the milk, swirly around, smear onto QUADTRANT (gently) - after you are done with that milk and put the cap on and close it.

FUCK THIS SHIT IM OUT

Repeat the process until you have filled up all quadrants and drag them across

DO NOT have to smear day 0 but you HAVE to take the PH of day 0
