Concept 29.1: Plants evolved from green algae
                Morphological and biochemical traits, as well as similarities in nuclear and chloroplast genes, indicate that certain charophyte algae are the closest living relatives of plants.
              
                A protective layer of sporopollenin and other traits allow charophytes to tolerate occasional drying along the edges of ponds and lakes. Such traits may have enabled the algal ancestors of plants to survive in terrestrial conditions, opening the way to the colonization of dry land.
              
                Derived traits that distinguish plants from charophytes, their closest algal relatives, include cuticles, stomata, multicellular dependent embryos, walled spores produced in sporangia, and the two shown here:
              
          
          
              
                         
                
              
          

          
                          1. Alternation of generations diagram in which the gametophyte (n) produces haploid gametes by mitosis. Gamete (n) from another plant is introduced and the two gametes unite (fertilization) and form a diploid zygote. The zygote (2 n) develops into a multicellular diploid sporophyte by mitosis. The sporophyte produces unicellular haploid spores by meiosis. The spores (n) develop into multicellular haploid gametophytes and the cycle begins again. 2. Apical meristems showed with the apical meristem of the shoot and developing leaves.           
          
        
                Fossils show that plants arose more than  ago. Subsequently, plants diverged into several major groups, including nonvascular plants (bryophytes); seedless vascular plants, such as lycophytes and ferns; and the two groups of seed plants: gymnosperms and angiosperms.
              Draw a phylogenetic tree illustrating our current understanding of plant phylogeny; label the common ancestor of plants and the origins of vascular tissue, apical meristems, and seeds.
        
      
    
      
        
          Concept 29.2: Mosses and other nonvascular plants have life cycles dominated by gametophytes
                Lineages leading to the three extant clades of nonvascular plants, or bryophytes—liverworts, mosses, and hornworts—diverged from other plants early in plant evolution.
              
                In bryophytes, the dominant generation consists of haploid gametophytes, such as those that make up a carpet of moss. Rhizoids anchor gametophytes to the substrate on which they grow. The flagellated sperm produced by antheridia require a film of water to travel to the eggs in the archegonia.
              
                The diploid stage of the life cycle—the sporophytes—grow out of archegonia and are attached to the gametophytes and dependent on them for nourishment. Smaller and simpler than vascular plant sporophytes, they typically consist of a foot, seta (stalk), and sporangium.
              
                Sphagnum, or peat moss, is common in large regions known as peatlands and has many practical uses, including as a fuel.
              Summarize the ecological importance of mosses.Concept 29.3: Ferns and other seedless vascular plants were the first plants to grow tall
                Fossils of the forerunners of today’s vascular plants date back about  and show that these small plants had independent, branching sporophytes and a vascular system.
              
                Over time, other derived traits of living vascular plants arose, such as a life cycle with dominant sporophytes, lignified vascular tissue, well-developed roots and leaves, and sporophylls.
              
                Seedless vascular plants include the lycophytes (phylum Lycophyta: club mosses, spikemosses, and quillworts) and the monilophytes (phylum Monilophyta: ferns, horsetails, and whisk ferns and relatives). Current evidence indicates that seedless vascular plants, like bryophytes, do not form a clade.
              
                Ancient lineages of lycophytes included both small herbaceous plants and large trees. Present-day lycophytes are small herbaceous plants.
              
                Seedless vascular plants formed the earliest forests  ago. Their growth may have contributed to a major global cooling that took place during the Carboniferous period. The decaying remnants of the first forests eventually became coal.
              What trait(s) allowed vascular plants to grow tall, and why might increased height have been advantageous?

## Concept 30.1: Seeds and pollen grains are key adaptations for life on land
<img src="https://o.quizlet.com/alWn7LY.UsRQFIR8cgxtWA.png" width="500px" alt="30.1">


> - Seeds are the primary source of food for most terrestrial animals.
> - Reduced gametophytes Microscopic male and female gametophytes (n) are nourished and protected by the sporophyte (2 n)   Heterospory Microspore gives rise to a male gametophyte. Megaspore gives rise to a female gametophyte.   Ovules Ovule (gymnosperm) has the following: integument (2 n), megaspore (n), and megasporangium (2 n)   Pollen Pollen grains make water unnecessary for fertilization   Seeds Seeds survive better than unprotected spores and can be transported long distances. A seed has a seed coat, food supply, and embryo.              
          
        Describe how the parts of an ovule (integument, megaspore, megasporangium) correspond to the parts of a seed.
## Concept 30.2: Gymnosperms bear “naked” seeds, typically on cones
> - Dominance of the sporophyte generation, the development of seeds from fertilized ovules, and the role of pollen in transferring sperm to ovules are key features of a typical gymnosperm life cycle.
>
> - Gymnosperms appear early in the plant fossil record and dominated many Mesozoic terrestrial ecosystems. Living seed plants can be divided into two monophyletic groups: gymnosperms and angiosperms. Extant gymnosperms include cycads, Ginkgo biloba, gnetophytes, and conifers.
>
> Although there are just over  species of gymnosperms, the group is still very successful in terms of its evolutionary longevity, adaptations, and geographic distribution. Explain.
        
      
    
      
## Concept 30.3: The reproductive adaptations of angiosperms include flowers and fruits
> Flowers generally consist of four types of modified leaves: sepals, petals, stamens (which produce pollen), and carpels (which produce ovules). Ovaries ripen into fruits, which often carry seeds by wind, water, or animals to new locations.
>             
> - Flowering plants originated about  ago, and by the mid-Cretaceous  had begun to dominate some terrestrial ecosystems. Fossils and phylogenetic analyses offer insights into the origin of flowers.
> 
> - Several groups of basal angiosperms have been identified. Other major clades of angiosperms include magnoliids, monocots, and eudicots.
>
> - Pollination and other interactions between angiosperms and animals may have contributed to the success of flowering plants during the last .
> Explain why Darwin called the origin of angiosperms an “abominable mystery,” and describe what has been learned from fossil evidence and phylogenetic analyses.
## Concept 30.4: Human welfare depends on seed plants

EVOLUTION CONNECTION The history of life has been punctuated by several mass extinctions. For example, the impact of a meteorite may have wiped out most of the dinosaurs and many forms of marine life at the end of the Cretaceous period (see Concept 25.4). Fossils indicate that plants were less severely affected by this mass extinction. What adaptations may have enabled plants to withstand this disaster better than animals?
## Levels 5-6: Evaluating/Creating
SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY • DRAW IT As will be described in detail in Concept 38.1, the female gametophyte of angiosperms typically has seven cells, one of which, the central cell, contains two haploid nuclei. After double fertilization, the central cell develops into endosperm, which is triploid. Because magnoliids, monocots, and eudicots typically have female gametophytes with seven cells and triploid endosperm, scientists assumed that this was the ancestral state for angiosperms. Consider, however, the following recent discoveries:
- Our understanding of angiosperm phylogeny has changed to that shown in Figure 30.14b.
- Amborella trichopoda has eight-celled female gametophytes and triploid endosperm.
- Water lilies and star anise have four-celled female gametophytes and diploid endosperm.

 Draw a phylogeny of the angiosperms (see Figure 30.14b), incorporating the data given above about the number of cells in female gametophytes and the ploidy of the endosperm. Assume that all of the star anise relatives have four-celled female gametophytes and diploid endosperm.

 What does your labeled phylogeny suggest about the evolution of the female gametophyte and endosperm in angiosperms?

WRITE ABOUT A THEME: ORGANIZATION Cells are the basic units of structure and function in all organisms. A key feature in the life cycle of plants is the alternation of multicellular haploid and diploid generations. Imagine a lineage of flowering plants in which mitotic cell division did not occur between the events of meiosis and fertilization (see Figure 30.12). In a short essay ( words), describe how this change in the timing of cell division would affect the structure and life cycle of plants in this lineage.

Such traits may have enabled the algal ancestors of plants to survive in terrestrial conditions, opening the way to the colonization of dry land.
              
                Derived traits that distinguish plants from charophytes, their closest algal relatives, include cuticles, stomata, multicellular dependent embryos, walled spores produced in sporangia, and the two shown here:
              
          
          
              
                         
                
              
          

          
                          1. Alternation of generations diagram in which the gametophyte (n) produces haploid gametes by mitosis. Gamete (n) from another plant is introduced and the two gametes unite (fertilization) and form a diploid zygote. The zygote (2 n) develops into a multicellular diploid sporophyte by mitosis. The sporophyte produces unicellular haploid spores by meiosis. The spores (n) develop into multicellular haploid gametophytes and the cycle begins again. 2. Apical meristems showed with the apical meristem of the shoot and developing leaves.           
          
        
                Fossils show that plants arose more than  ago. Subsequently, plants diverged into several major groups, including nonvascular plants (bryophytes); seedless vascular plants, such as lycophytes and ferns; and the two groups of seed plants: gymnosperms and angiosperms.
              Draw a phylogenetic tree illustrating our current understanding of plant phylogeny; label the common ancestor of plants and the origins of vascular tissue, apical meristems, and seeds.
        
      
    
      
        
          Concept 29.2: Mosses and other nonvascular plants have life cycles dominated by gametophytes
                Lineages leading to the three extant clades of nonvascular plants, or bryophytes—liverworts, mosses, and hornworts—diverged from other plants early in plant evolution.
              
                In bryophytes, the dominant generation consists of haploid gametophytes, such as those that make up a carpet of moss. Rhizoids anchor gametophytes to the substrate on which they grow. The flagellated sperm produced by antheridia require a film of water to travel to the eggs in the archegonia.
              
                The diploid stage of the life cycle—the sporophytes—grow out of archegonia and are attached to the gametophytes and dependent on them for nourishment. Smaller and simpler than vascular plant sporophytes, they typically consist of a foot, seta (stalk), and sporangium.
              
                Sphagnum, or peat moss, is common in large regions known as peatlands and has many practical uses, including as a fuel.
              Summarize the ecological importance of mosses.Concept 29.3: Ferns and other seedless vascular plants were the first plants to grow tall
                Fossils of the forerunners of today’s vascular plants date back about  and show that these small plants had independent, branching sporophytes and a vascular system.
              
                Over time, other derived traits of living vascular plants arose, such as a life cycle with dominant sporophytes, lignified vascular tissue, well-developed roots and leaves, and sporophylls.
              
                Seedless vascular plants include the lycophytes (phylum Lycophyta: club mosses, spikemosses, and quillworts) and the monilophytes (phylum Monilophyta: ferns, horsetails, and whisk ferns and relatives). Current evidence indicates that seedless vascular plants, like bryophytes, do not form a clade.
              
                Ancient lineages of lycophytes included both small herbaceous plants and large trees. Present-day lycophytes are small herbaceous plants.
              
                Seedless vascular plants formed the earliest forests  ago. Their growth may have contributed to a major global cooling that took place during the Carboniferous period. The decaying remnants of the first forests eventually became coal.
              What trait(s) allowed vascular plants to grow tall, and why might increased height have been advantageous?

Summary of Key ConceptsTo review key terms, go to the Vocabulary Self-Quiz.

## Concept 30.1: Seeds and pollen grains are key adaptations for life on land
<img src="https://o.quizlet.com/alWn7LY.UsRQFIR8cgxtWA.png" width="500px" alt="30.1">


> - Seeds are the primary source of food for most terrestrial animals.
> - Reduced gametophytes Microscopic male and female gametophytes (n) are nourished and protected by the sporophyte (2 n)   Heterospory Microspore gives rise to a male gametophyte. Megaspore gives rise to a female gametophyte.   Ovules Ovule (gymnosperm) has the following: integument (2 n), megaspore (n), and megasporangium (2 n)   Pollen Pollen grains make water unnecessary for fertilization   Seeds Seeds survive better than unprotected spores and can be transported long distances. A seed has a seed coat, food supply, and embryo.              
          
        Describe how the parts of an ovule (integument, megaspore, megasporangium) correspond to the parts of a seed.
## Concept 30.2: Gymnosperms bear “naked” seeds, typically on cones
> - Dominance of the sporophyte generation, the development of seeds from fertilized ovules, and the role of pollen in transferring sperm to ovules are key features of a typical gymnosperm life cycle.
>
> - Gymnosperms appear early in the plant fossil record and dominated many Mesozoic terrestrial ecosystems. Living seed plants can be divided into two monophyletic groups: gymnosperms and angiosperms. Extant gymnosperms include cycads, Ginkgo biloba, gnetophytes, and conifers.
>
> Although there are just over  species of gymnosperms, the group is still very successful in terms of its evolutionary longevity, adaptations, and geographic distribution. Explain.
        
      
    
      
## Concept 30.3: The reproductive adaptations of angiosperms include flowers and fruits
> Flowers generally consist of four types of modified leaves: sepals, petals, stamens (which produce pollen), and carpels (which produce ovules). Ovaries ripen into fruits, which often carry seeds by wind, water, or animals to new locations.
>             
> - Flowering plants originated about  ago, and by the mid-Cretaceous  had begun to dominate some terrestrial ecosystems. Fossils and phylogenetic analyses offer insights into the origin of flowers.
> 
> - Several groups of basal angiosperms have been identified. Other major clades of angiosperms include magnoliids, monocots, and eudicots.
>
> - Pollination and other interactions between angiosperms and animals may have contributed to the success of flowering plants during the last .
> Explain why Darwin called the origin of angiosperms an “abominable mystery,” and describe what has been learned from fossil evidence and phylogenetic analyses.
## Concept 30.4: Human welfare depends on seed plants
> - Humans depend on seed plants for products such as food, wood, and many medicines.
> - Destruction of habitat threatens the extinction of many plant species and the animal species they support.
>              
> Explain why destroying the remaining tropical forests might harm humans and lead to a mass extinction.

EVOLUTION CONNECTION The history of life has been punctuated by several mass extinctions. For example, the impact of a meteorite may have wiped out most of the dinosaurs and many forms of marine life at the end of the Cretaceous period (see Concept 25.4). Fossils indicate that plants were less severely affected by this mass extinction. What adaptations may have enabled plants to withstand this disaster better than animals?
## Levels 5-6: Evaluating/Creating
SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY • DRAW IT As will be described in detail in Concept 38.1, the female gametophyte of angiosperms typically has seven cells, one of which, the central cell, contains two haploid nuclei. After double fertilization, the central cell develops into endosperm, which is triploid. Because magnoliids, monocots, and eudicots typically have female gametophytes with seven cells and triploid endosperm, scientists assumed that this was the ancestral state for angiosperms. Consider, however, the following recent discoveries:
- Our understanding of angiosperm phylogeny has changed to that shown in Figure 30.14b.
- Amborella trichopoda has eight-celled female gametophytes and triploid endosperm.
- Water lilies and star anise have four-celled female gametophytes and diploid endosperm.

 Draw a phylogeny of the angiosperms (see Figure 30.14b), incorporating the data given above about the number of cells in female gametophytes and the ploidy of the endosperm. Assume that all of the star anise relatives have four-celled female gametophytes and diploid endosperm.

 What does your labeled phylogeny suggest about the evolution of the female gametophyte and endosperm in angiosperms?

WRITE ABOUT A THEME: ORGANIZATION Cells are the basic units of structure and function in all organisms. A key feature in the life cycle of plants is the alternation of multicellular haploid and diploid generations. Imagine a lineage of flowering plants in which mitotic cell division did not occur between the events of meiosis and fertilization (see Figure 30.12). In a short essay ( words), describe how this change in the timing of cell division would affect the structure and life cycle of plants in this lineage.

Hypothesis 1: Crustose, foliose, and fruticose lichens each represent a monophyletic group. Hypothesis 2: Each lichen growth form represents convergent evolution by diverse fungal groups.

                SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY Bats emit ultrasonic sounds and then use the returning echoes of those sounds to locate and capture flying insects, such as moths, in the dark. In response to bat attacks, some tiger moths make ultrasonic clicks of their own. Researchers hypothesize that tiger moth clicks likely either (1) jam the bat’s sonar or (2) warn the bat about the moth’s toxic chemical defenses. The graph below shows two patterns observed in studies of moth capture rates over time.

SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY • DRAW IT As a consequence of size alone, larger organisms tend to have larger brains than smaller organisms. However, some organisms have brains that are considerably larger than expected for their size.
