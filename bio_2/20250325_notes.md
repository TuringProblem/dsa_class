## Ecological impacs of land plants

> mosses (bryophyta) play a role in regulatin climate
>
> - due to lightweight spores, mosses are cosmopolitan
> - Peat moss (sphagnum) is widespread in wetlands
> - Moss cell walls are resistant to decomposition
> - Mosses buried in peatlands is often harvested for fuel

## Greenhouse gases

> The **_"Greenhouse"_** effect
>
> - Helps maintain a stable temperature climate on earth
> - Excess greenhouse gases store more infarred radiation (heat)
>   > - Carbon Diozide (CO2)
>   > - Methane (CH4)
>   > - Nitrous Oxide (N2O)
>   > - Water vapor (H2O)
>   >   if you have a lot of c02 in the atmosphere, it will trap more heat and cause the earth to warm up
>
> As plants do their thing (pulling c02), it starts to bring the levels down - cooling the earth
>
> When photosynthetic rates drop, then the atomsphere will start to warm up again

## Ecological impacts of land plants

> The carboniferous period (~360-300 mya) sequestered large amounts of carbon
>
> - Large-scale photosynthesis incorporeated carbon from CO2 into plant biomass (wood)
> - Similar to mosses, much of this plant biomass did not decompose
> - This sequestered carbon became coal - in oceans where you have phytoplankton/Zooplankton, turns into oil (so they say)

## Greenhouse gases

> - Humans began extractin glarge amounts of fossil fuels during the 2nd industrial revolution

## Adaptations of seed plants

> - Reduced gametophyte
> - Heterospory
> - Ovules
> - Pollen
> - Seeds

> - Seeds plants make two differnt kinds of spores in two different kinds of sporangia
> - Megasporangium produce megaspores by meiosis
>   > - Megaspores develop into female gametophytes
>   > - Female gametophytes produce eggs
> - Microsporangium produce microspores by meiosis
>   > **_*Ovules*_** - is the megasporangium (2n), and megaspore (n) protected by integument(s)
> - The integument(s) has/have openings through which a pollen grain or sperm can enter
>   **_*Micropyle*_** -
>
> **_*Pollen*_**
>
> - Microsporangia make microspores -> microspores become pollen -> pollen grains are released by the plant
> - Inside each pollen grain is a gametophyte which makes sperm and a pollen tube
>   > - Multiple nuclei are formed by mitosis
>   > - 2 become sperm, 1 becomes a pollen tube
> - When pollen reaches an ovule, the pollen tube delivers sperm nuclei
> - Pollen grains are well adapted for dispersal
> - cups on some pollen is an adaptation for wind dispersal
> - Some pollen grains have barbs for animal dispersal
>
> **_*Angiosperms*_** - has a lot more variation in seed and fruit structure because some are also still wind pollenated and some are animal pollenated
> **_*Seed*_** - a baby plant that is in a box (based on the parent sporophyte) and has food in it (baby plant -> in a box -> with it's lunch) - but needs enough energy to get out of the box and start photosynthesizing
>
> > - Can remain formant and viable for a time
> > - Multicellular prtective covering (seed coat)
>
> - Both seeds and spores are dispersal mechanisms in plants

## Naked seeds

Gymnosperms

> - "Naked" because their seed because their seeds lack any tissue beyond the seed coat
>   4 Phyla
> - Cycadophyta
> - Ginkgophyta
> - Gnetophyta
> - Coniferophyta
