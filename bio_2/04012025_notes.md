# Fungi nutrition and ecology

- Heterotrophic - cannot fix carbon
  -absirotiuve
- Secrete hydrolytic enzymes to break down macromolecules
- absorb nutrients from their environment

-live in/on substrate from which they absorb nutrients

- Dead plants or animals
- Animal wastes
- Host organisms
- Other organic carbon sources (e.g., bread, soil)
  -Collectively, fungi have a wide variey of enzymes

## Written on the board

(
Fungi have some "Rare" Enzymes: cellulases, Ligninases
"myco" = fungus
"Rhiz" = root
"Ceono" = common
"cyte" = cell
"gam(y)" = union
"kary" = nucleus
Chitin: A structural polysaccharide
Found in: Fungal cell walls exoskeleton of arthropods
)

# Fungi nutrition and ecology (continued)

-Decomposers:

- Cycle organic carbon from dead/dying organisms back to CO2.
  -Parasites:
- Break down tissues of host organisms
- Human examples: ringworm, yeast infection, athlete's foot, fungal meningitis
  -Mutalistic symbionts
- Fungi and plant roots = mycorrhizae
  - Help pass materials from soil into roots, recieve carbohydrates from plants
- Fungi and lgae (cyanobacteria or protists) = Lichens

### Lichens

- Algae fixes carbon (photosynthesis) and sometimes nitrogen
- Fungus provides a more stable and appropriate environment
- This "partnership" allows colonization of bare rock
- Over time, can create a thin layer allowing plants to colonize (primary succession)

### Fungal anatomy

- Cell walls made of **_chitin_** (polymer)

^ missed stuff above

### Fungal anatomy (continued)

#### General characteristics

Mycelium

- Composed of **hyphae**
- Hyphae are microscopic filaments lined with chitinous cell walls.
  > Two Types:
  > Septate hypha
  >
  > Coenocytic hypha
  > Hyphae in mycorrhizal fungi
- Hyphae exchange materials between plant cells and the fungusHyphae in mycorrhizal fungi
- Hyphae exchange materials between plant cells and the fungusHyphae in mycorrhizal fungi
- Hyphae exchange materials between plant cells and the fungusHyphae in mycorrhizal fungi
- Hyphae exchange materials between plant cells and the fungusHyphae in mycorrhizal fungi
- Hyphae exchange materials between plant cells and the fungus
- These specialized hypha are **_haustoria_**
  two types:
  > Ectomycorrhiza:
  >
  > > Ecto = outer
  > >
  > > Grow into plant root, but _outside_ of plant root cells
  > > Arbuscular mycorrhiza
  > > arbor = tree

### Generic fungal life cycle

Most fungi reproduce both asecually and sexually

- Asexual reproduction in favorable conditions (optimal temperatures, moisture, nutrients)
- Sexual reproduction in less favorable conditions
  > - New combinations of alleles offer chance to be better suited to survive

plasmogamyte - when two hyphae of different mating types meet and their cytoplasms fuse.
(n+n) not just (n) but they are still HAPLOIDS!! ( Heterokaryotic stage )
karyogamy - fusion of nuclei
Dikaryotic is a special case of heterokaryotic stage where the cells have two nuclei (n+n) for a period of time before karyogamy occurs.
