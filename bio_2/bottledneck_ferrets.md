### Black-footed Ferrets Near Extinction
> The black-footed ferret is the cutest vicious killer in the world. Also known as the American polecat (and as *Mustela nigripes*), this member of weasel family is a specialist predator of *Prairie dogs*. Black-footed ferrets were once distributed throughout the *American Great Plans*. However, due to habitat loss and extirpation of its prey, the black-footed ferret was nearly driven to extinction. Indeed, it was thought to be extinct at the end of the 1970s. In 1981, a lone surviving population was found near Meeteetse, Wyoming.
>
> In 1985, the Meeteetse population numbered about 40 individuals. Then the population was hit by two diseases, canine distemper and sylvatic plague. Eighteen individuals were taken into captivity for a managed breeding program. In 1986, no individuals were known to remain in the wild.
>
> The captive breeding program has been sufficiently successful that wildlife managers have been reintroducing black-footed ferrets into the wild for two decades. Self-sustaining populations have been established in South Dakota, Arizona, and Wyoming. Efforts continue to establish more. Not surprisingly, ferrets do better where there are lots of prairie dogs to eat.
>
> However, low numbers and scarce food are not only challenges the black-footed ferrets face. ***Genetic Diversity*** is also a concern. All extant members of the species are descended from just seven individuals. In this tutorial, you will investigate why this ***population bottleneck*** in the black-footed ferret's recent past may continue to threaten its survival. At the end, you will have a chance to conduct experiments to determine the best way to allocate limited conservation resources to best preserve what remains of the ferret's genetic heritage.

### Tracking Alleles
example using a large population of ferrets
> To give a visual indication of genetic diversity, some of the ferrets have lighter coats and others darker coats. Coat color is determined by a single fictitious **Gene** with 2 ***alleles***: allele S, for "Standard", and allele C, for "Charred"
>
> In truth, although much is known about the genetics of coat color in other mammals, little is known about the genetics of coat color in black-footed ferrets. However, by studying the hypothetical coat color gene we have created for this tutorial, you will learn general principles that apply to all genes for all ***traits*** - including invisible but crucially important traits like resistance to disease.
>
> One thing to keep in mind during this tutorial is that your simulated ferret population's coat color and underlying genotype have no effect whatsoever on a ferret's ability to survive and reproduce. Alleles *S* and *C* are neutral. Coat colors is ***NOT*** subject to ***Natural selection***.
