# **Chapter 23: The Evolution of Populations**

## **Chapter 23: Evolution of Populations Study Chart**

| **Concept**               | **Definition** | **Key Details** | **Key Takeaway** |
|--------------------------|--------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Microevolution** | Small-scale evolution, changes in allele frequencies within a population over generations. | Can result from mutation, genetic drift, gene flow, and natural selection. | Leads to diversity within populations and can contribute to speciation. |
| **Genetic Variation** | Differences in DNA sequences among individuals in a population. | Essential for evolution; arises from mutation, recombination, and gene flow. | Without genetic variation, populations cannot evolve through natural selection. |
| **Mutation** | Random changes in an organism’s DNA that may introduce new alleles. | Most mutations are neutral or harmful; some provide advantages. | The ultimate source of genetic variation. |
| **Gene Pool** | The total genetic diversity found within a population. | Affected by mutations, selection, drift, and migration. | Large gene pools allow for greater adaptability. |
| **Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium** | A model stating that allele frequencies remain constant unless evolutionary forces act. | Requires five conditions: no mutations, random mating, large population, no gene flow, and no natural selection. | If any condition is violated, evolution occurs. |
| **Hardy-Weinberg Equation** | Used to calculate allele and genotype frequencies. | Equation: \( p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1 \) where \( p \) and \( q \) are allele frequencies. | Can determine if a population is evolving. |
| **Genetic Drift** | Random changes in allele frequencies due to chance events. | More significant in small populations; leads to loss of genetic diversity. | Can result in the **bottleneck effect** or **founder effect**. |
| **Bottleneck Effect** | A sharp reduction in population size due to environmental events or disasters. | Drastically reduces genetic diversity. | Can lead to fixation of alleles and loss of adaptability. |
| **Founder Effect** | When a new population is established by a few individuals from a larger population. | Can result in different allele frequencies than the original population. | Leads to reduced genetic variation and potential inbreeding. |
| **Gene Flow** | The transfer of alleles between populations. | Increases genetic diversity; can homogenize populations. | Prevents populations from diverging too much. |
| **Natural Selection** | Process by which individuals with advantageous traits reproduce more successfully. | The only evolutionary mechanism that leads to **adaptive evolution**. | Over time, favorable traits become more common in the population. |
| **Relative Fitness** | The contribution an individual makes to the gene pool relative to others. | Individuals with higher relative fitness leave more offspring. | Natural selection favors traits that increase fitness. |
| **Types of Selection** | **Directional Selection**: Favors one extreme.  **Stabilizing Selection**: Favors the intermediate trait.  **Disruptive Selection**: Favors both extremes. | Example: Directional – Peppered moths; Stabilizing – Human birth weight; Disruptive – Finch beak size. | Selection alters trait distributions in populations. |
| **Sexual Selection** | Natural selection for traits related to mating success. | **Intrasexual selection** (competition within a sex) and **intersexual selection** (mate choice). | Can lead to exaggerated traits, like peacock feathers. |
| **Heterozygote Advantage** | When heterozygous individuals have higher fitness than either homozygote. | Example: Sickle-cell trait provides malaria resistance. | Maintains genetic diversity in populations. |
| **Frequency-Dependent Selection** | The fitness of a phenotype depends on how common it is. | Example: Scale-eating fish with left/right mouth morphs. | Maintains multiple phenotypes within a population. |
| **Macroevolution** | Large-scale evolutionary changes, including the formation of new species. | Encompasses speciation and large genetic shifts over long periods. | Results in new taxonomic groups and evolutionary trends. |

## **Study Strategy for Chapter 23**
✅ **Understand the role of genetic variation and how it affects evolution.**  
✅ **Memorize the Hardy-Weinberg conditions and be able to use the equation for allele frequency problems.**  
✅ **Recognize different types of selection and their impact on populations.**  
✅ **Explain genetic drift and its effects on small populations.**  
✅ **Use real-world examples to reinforce key concepts.**

### **Final Takeaways**
✔ **Microevolution occurs due to mutation, genetic drift, gene flow, and natural selection.**  
✔ **Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium describes non-evolving populations; deviations indicate evolution is occurring.**  
✔ **Natural selection is the only mechanism that consistently leads to adaptation.**  
✔ **Genetic drift has a greater effect on small populations and can cause random loss of alleles.**  
✔ **Gene flow can increase genetic diversity and reduce differences between populations.**
