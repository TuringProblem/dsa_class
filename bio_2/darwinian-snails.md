# Section 1: *Snail Shells*
### The Importance of Shell Thickness
> The flat periwinkle is a small snail that lives on seaweeds growing on the rocky shores of the ***<a href="#fn1">intertidal zone</a>***[^1] in New England. Among the snail's enemies is the European green crab. As its name suggest, the European green crab is not native to North America. It traveled from Europe early in the 19th century. Before 1900, the green crab did not occur north of Cape Cod, Massacusetts. After the turn of the century, however, the crab expanded its range northward, and is now found as far north as [Nova Scotia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_Scotia). The crab's range expansion introduced perwinkle populations north of Cap Cod to a new predator.
>
> Biologist [Robin Seeley]() suspected that New England's periwinkle populations have evolved thicker shells due to predation by green crabs. In a museum, Seeley found an 1871 collection of periwinkles from [Appledore Island](), north of Cape Cod. She compared the thickness of old shells to thicknesses of new shells she had fathered herself at the same place.

### Histograms
> You can compare shell thicknesses from 1871 to the 1980s, as Seeley did, using graphs called ***<a href="#fn2" style="">histograms</a>***[^2]. Histograms are powerful way to summarize variation among individuals in a population and to compare populations.
>
> Nine values of shell thickness from Seeley's 1980s data appear in the table below. Each number represents a single shell. Don't worry about the unit of measure. Seeley plotted her data as the logarithm of thickness, which we have converted to integers. Larger numbers indicate thicker shells.

# Section 3: Requirements for Natural Selection
### How Does Natural Selection Work?
> You saw the snail population <a href="#fn4">evolve</a>[^4] (*change over time*) as a result of predation--a form of selection. What is required for such change to take place? This section of the tutorial explores several conditions that affect whether the population will change as individuals are selected.
>
> To make things simplier, in this section there will be no <a href="#fn5">mutations</a>[^5] in shell thickness, and no snails will ever enter or leave this population from elsewhere.
>
> To start, perform a thought experiment. Imagine that all the snails started out with the same shell thickness. ***Could the population stil evolve***?




[^1]: **Intertidal zone**: The area in marine aquatic environments that is covered with water at high tide but exposed when water retreats at low tide.<br><br>Organisms that live within the intertidal zone are adapted to living in extreme and variable conditions due to exposure, salinity, etc. The intertidal zone is divided into lower, mid and upper areas, which have unique environmental conditions related to how long the shore is exposed to air vs. water. Some species prefer to be exposed to air, whereas others prefer to be submerged for longer periods.
[^2]: **Histograms**: Graphical depiction of the <a href="#fn3">***distribution***</a>[^3] of data for a particular variable. Histograms show the frequencies of particular values that occur in the population. In this tutorial, we use histograms to show the relative frequencies of the trait values for snail shell thickness.
[^3]: **Distribution**: The distribution of a variable is the arrangement of its values that indicates their frequency of occurence.<br><br>Often, a distribution is displayed as a <a href="#fn1" style="">***histogram***</a>. A data distribution shows the variable's observed frequencies, whereas a probablity distribution shows its theoretical frequencies.
