| **Concept**               | **Definition** | **Key Details** | **Key Takeaway** |
|--------------------------|--------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Evolution** | Change in the genetic composition of a population over generations. | Affects populations, not individuals. Driven by mutation, natural selection, genetic drift, and gene flow. | Evolution occurs over long time scales and is supported by multiple lines of evidence. |
| **Adaptation** | A heritable trait that improves an organismâ€™s ability to survive and reproduce. | Must be genetic (not learned). Adaptations arise through natural selection. | Organisms with beneficial adaptations have higher fitness. |
| **Natural Selection** | Process where individuals with advantageous traits reproduce more successfully. | Acts on **existing variation**. Requires differential survival and reproduction. | Leads to the accumulation of beneficial traits over generations. |
| **Artificial Selection** | Humans selectively breed organisms for desired traits. | Used in agriculture and domestication (e.g., crops, livestock). | Shows how selection can drive rapid evolutionary changes. |
| **Biogeography** | Study of geographic distribution of species. | Island species resemble mainland relatives but show unique adaptations. | Geographic isolation can lead to speciation over time. |
| **Fossil Record** | Preserved remains or imprints of organisms showing evolutionary changes over time. | Shows transitional fossils (e.g., Tiktaalik, Archaeopteryx). | Demonstrates gradual changes and the emergence of new species. |
| **Homologous Structures** | Structures that share a common **ancestry** but may have different functions. | Human arm, bat wing, whale flipper. Same skeletal structure but different uses. | Evidence for common descent. |
| **Analogous Structures** | Structures with similar functions but **different evolutionary origins**. | Bird wings vs. insect wings. | Result of **convergent evolution**, not shared ancestry. |
| **Vestigial Structures** | Reduced or nonfunctional traits inherited from ancestors. | Human appendix, whale pelvis. | Evidence of evolutionary change over time. |
| **Molecular Homology** | Similar DNA, proteins, and genes among related species. | Hox genes control body plans across species. | More genetic similarity = closer evolutionary relationship. |
| **Darwinâ€™s Observations** | 1. Variation exists. 2. More offspring are produced than can survive. | Leads to competition and struggle for existence. | Variation + competition drive evolution. |
| **Darwinâ€™s Inferences** | Favorable traits increase survival & reproduction. | Over generations, beneficial traits accumulate. | Natural selection leads to adaptation. |
| **Genetic Variation** | Differences in DNA among individuals of a population. | Sources: mutation, recombination, gene flow. | Essential for natural selection to work. |
| **Mutation** | Random changes in DNA that can introduce new traits. | Can be neutral, harmful, or beneficial. | Provides raw material for evolution. |
| **Overproduction** | Organisms produce more offspring than the environment can support. | Leads to competition for resources. | Only some offspring survive to reproduce. |
| **Struggle for Existence** | Limited resources mean only some individuals survive. | Food, mates, territory competition. | Drives differential reproductive success. |
| **Directional Selection** | Favors one extreme trait in a population. | Example: Larger beaks favored in drought conditions. | Shifts population traits toward one extreme. |
| **Stabilizing Selection** | Favors intermediate traits over extremes. | Example: Human birth weight (too small = risk, too large = risk). | Reduces variation, favors average traits. |
| **Disruptive Selection** | Favors both extremes, selecting against the middle. | Example: Light & dark colored oysters survive, but medium ones donâ€™t. | Can lead to **speciation**. |
| **Convergent Evolution** | Unrelated species evolve similar traits due to similar environments. | Sharks and dolphins have streamlined bodies. | Results from similar selection pressures, not shared ancestry. |
| **Divergent Evolution** | When a common ancestor gives rise to multiple different species. | GalÃ¡pagos finches have different beaks. | Leads to **adaptive radiation**. |
| **Microevolution** | Small changes in allele frequencies within a population. | Change in beak size of finches over a few generations. | Happens **quickly** within a few generations. |
| **Macroevolution** | Large-scale changes leading to new species. | Origin of birds from theropod dinosaurs. | Takes **millions of years**. |
| **Reproductive Isolation** | When populations can no longer interbreed. | Prezygotic (before fertilization) vs. postzygotic (after fertilization). | **Required for speciation to occur**. |
| **Hardy-Weinberg Principle** | A population is **not evolving** if allele frequencies remain constant. | 5 conditions: **No mutation, random mating, large population, no selection, no gene flow.** | If violated, **evolution is happening**. |
| **Sexual Selection** | Traits that improve mating success, even if they donâ€™t help survival. | Peacock feathers attract mates but increase predation risk. | Can lead to exaggerated traits. |
| **Gene Flow** | Movement of alleles between populations. | Immigration/emigration introduces new genes. | Increases genetic diversity, reduces differences between populations. |
| **Genetic Drift** | Random changes in allele frequencies, especially in small populations. | Bottleneck effect (cheetahs), Founder effect (island species). | Can lead to **loss of variation**. |

## **Study Strategy for Chapter 22**
âœ… **Memorize key terms** and understand their relationships.  
âœ… **Use real-world examples** to reinforce concepts.  
âœ… **Look at diagrams & visuals** â€“ especially for homologous structures, selection types, and biogeography.  
âœ… **Practice explaining concepts in your own words** â€“ helps with written questions.  
âœ… **Understand evolutionary evidence** â€“ common multiple-choice section.

### **Final Takeaways**
âœ” **Evolution is backed by multiple lines of evidence.**  
âœ” **Natural selection is NOT random, but variation is.**  
âœ” **Populations evolve, NOT individuals.**  
âœ” **Reproductive isolation leads to new species.**  
âœ” **Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium = No evolution (rare in nature).**
