Polynomial - counting how many variables we have / algorithm

ARRRay - fixed, contiguous space in memory.
int[] name = new int{}


Is an algorithm the solution ? No it is jsut the steps taken to help get to the solution much faster.

syntax error - error in the code (i.e., you did not type the correct syntax.)
logical error - something is hidden within the code

two types of the array, void or return type.


how do we distinguish one array 

"signature" - corresponds with overloading.

compile - convert high level language into executable
runtime - runtime to get the results.

# actual notes 


if a program requires fast insertion 

computational problem - if you want to do anything automated.
