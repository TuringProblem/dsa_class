### Singly6-linked list data structure

> A **_singly-linked list_** is a data structure for implementing a list ADT(abstract data type), where each [node](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(computer_science)>) has data (or sometimes referred to as a value) and a pointer to the **next** node. The list structure typically has pointers to the list's first node and last node.
