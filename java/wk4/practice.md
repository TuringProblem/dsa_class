1. Given list (10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15), how many comparisons will be made during the **_third_** outer loop execution `(i = 3)`?

# What is Insertion sort?

1. Work left to right.
2. Examine each item and compare it to items on its left.
3. **Insert** the item in the correct position in the array.

The first iteration is i[0] -> There is nothing to the left of it so it is sorted, i[1] (second iteration) -> 11, i[2] -> 12, and i[3] -> 13 (Making four comparisons)
