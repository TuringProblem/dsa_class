# 5.4 Queue abstract data type (ADT)

> ### Queue abstract data type
>
> A **_queue_** is an ADT in which items are inserted at the end of the queue and removed from the front of the queue. The queue **_enqueue_** operation inserts an item at the end of the queue. The queue **_dequeue_** operation removes and returns the item in at the front of the queue. Ex: After the operations "Enqueue 7", "Enqueue 14", and "Enqueue 9", "Dequeue" returns 7. A second "Dequeue" returns 14. A queue is referred to as **_First-in first out_**(FIFO) ADT. A queue can be implemented using a LinkedList or Array.

> A queue ADT is similar to waiting in line at the grocery store. A person enters at the end of the line and exits at the front. British English actually uses the word "queue" in everyday vernacular where American English uses the word "line".
